This is a simple tic tac toe implementation in Python with Command Line interface, It takes a 3 x 3 matrix with 2 players.

- What is the aim of this project?<br>
This is more of a take home assignment, I created this as part of interview process with [colearn](https://colearn.co/)


- What is the default game configuration?<br>
This starts with 2 players , firstly by asking their names and choosing their symbols they want to go with.

- What is the input format?<br>
There are multple ways to take input from players, but in my current project I am taking input as x coordinates, y coordinates
